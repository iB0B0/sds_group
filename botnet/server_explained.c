/* Simple server architecture - detailed explanation
Listens for connection and sends message to connected client
Please note, all of the code below is absent of any error checking. This is for
2 reasons. Firstly, I just haven't implemented any, yet, but more importantly,
it keeps the code clean to help you understand. Another worthy note is the
absence of functions. Again, this is to better demonstrate the flow of the
program */

    ai_socktype - stores the socket type, stream (SOCK_STREAM) or datagram (SOCK_DGRAM)

    ai_addrlen - stores the size of ai_addr in bytes
    ai_addr - stores a pointer to a sockaddr struct
    ai_next - points to next element in linked list
